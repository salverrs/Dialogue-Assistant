# Dialogue Assistant
Adds the ability to highlight and lock (disable) NPC chat dialogue options.

To highlight or lock an option, right-click the option during the chat dialogue and select the corresponding action.

### Configuring

You can change the text colour for highlighted and locked options using the plugin config.

Dialogue preferences are stored per NPC ID, characters can often share a name but have a unique ID, take this into account when configuring dialogue options.
